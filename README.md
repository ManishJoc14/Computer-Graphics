## **Graphics Library Setup**

---

### **Quick Setup**  
Clone the repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/ManishJoc14/Computer-Graphics.git  
```  

Your directory structure should look like this:  
```plaintext  
├───.vscode  
└───Home  
    ├───build  
    └───src  
```  

To run the build task, simply press **`Ctrl+Shift+B`**. The executable file will be generated in the `build` folder.  

---

### **Important Notes**  
- **`src` Folder**: Contains the source code for the graphics project.  
- **`build` Folder**: The compiler generates `.exe` files in this folder after building.  
- **`.vscode` Folder**: Includes `c_cpp_properties.json` and task configurations. You need to modify these files based on your system's environment and compiler type.
